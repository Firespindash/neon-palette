# neon-palette
It's an html page with my personal collection of color palettes, it also contains neon color gradients, to help choosing colors.

These colors and gradients are the main used by me in other projects. It started when I was searching for better colors for digital design. Then I discovered the "neon colors", and realized that these good colors usually are bright ones or careful selected ones. That's the reason I started making this, my selection of palettes and gradients. Hopefully, it can help other people too. So I decided to let it public. I found these colors useful to make from pixel art to vector design.

The html page contains the primary neon colors from my search and gradients I found too. And the .zip file containing the color palettes with nice colors compressed. There are more than 50 palettes in the .zip file.

I took the colors and gradients on *Pinterest*, *ColorHunt* and *Instagram* lol.
I picked the palettes on *ColorHunt* website searching for neon colors. And mainly some beautiful gradients made by *Mehdi Khodamoradi* UX designer.

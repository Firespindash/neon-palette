I already used these colors and gradients in another project. It's based in part of colors theory. Making some researches I found neon colors, these colors are useful to make from pixel art to vectors. For digital design these colors help a lot. So I created this html page to help in color choices using only these colors.

The html page contains mainly the gradients I found and the .zip file contains the color palettes compressed. There are more than 50 palettes in the .zip file.

Good places to search about neon colors and gradients and places that I searched are Pinterest, ColorHunt and Instagram.
I picked the palettes on colorhunt website searching for neon colors. If you want more palettes like these search for Mehdi Khodamoradi UX designer.
